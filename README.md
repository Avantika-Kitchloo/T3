# T3

	Investment Management T3 workflow" is a state of the art workflow tool to automate a complex separately managed mandate take-on process for traditional asset management business. The workflow solution is implemented on the PEGA framework and provides a lifecycle view of the client & mandate take-on process. The workflow tool uses an object oriented design to implement features at a firm, division and project level thereby allowing for sharing key features. The big win because of this tool is to have a single global client & mandate take-on process across Investment management. The workflow tool allows for:
	Authentication - LDAP
	Entitlement - E3
	Parallel sub-flows - Parallelism and dependencies in the process (Attached is the actual process)
	Audit trail - Case History
	Document retention- Documentum
	Integration with key systems like Salesforce/MB+ & AGCIS
	Enhanced statistics and executive reporting
	Process improvement ideas
	Potential SLA and deadline tracking
	T3, SMA Mandate take-on workflow, PEGA
	Technology Stack - PegaPRPC7 with SQL and SOAP integrations.

Current State SMA mandate take-on process is a manual process where
o Each stakeholder team maintains individual checklists to record tasks, milestones &
data
o Communication & next steps are conveyed via e-mail / phone
o Some teams use a common meeting where the take-on & specific responsibilities get
discussed
o Client take-on form is used to setup data in AGCIS
o The client take-on business process definition has a broad agreement but specific
nuances can vary case by case
o There is no documented workflow definition for the T3 SMA take-on process
1.3 Challenges with current process
 Challenges to the current process are
o No formal sign-off capture mechanism to record that a particular T3 SMA take-on
milestone is complete
o No mechanism to capture who completed a particular checklist and who gave a
checker sign-off as part of an four eye check
